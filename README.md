1. Introduction
   -	Project Overview:
➢	The Cooking Assistant is envisioned as a desktop application tailored for elderly users, providing an intuitive interface for storing, retrieving, and organizing cooking instructions and recipes.
   -	Objective:
➢	The primary goal is to develop a GUI application that is as user-friendly as possible. It should have a robust backend functionality for managing recipe data, images, and optional ratings. The application aims to assist elderly users in easily accessing and following cooking instructions.
2. Functional Requirements
   -	Database Management:
➢	Utilize a relational database system for the efficient storage of recipes, instructions, images, and ratings. Implement basic data operations to manage the database.
   -	GUI Features:
➢	Design an intuitive interface displaying recipes with associated images and ratings.
➢	 Implement a search functionality to allow users to filter recipes by name or rating.
   -	Thread Management:
➢	Employ multi-threading to ensure responsiveness and smooth interaction with the application, especially during data retrieval and display.
   -	Process Synchronization:
➢	Implement synchronization mechanisms (locks, semaphores) to manage concurrent access to shared resources, preventing data inconsistencies.
   -	Error Handling:
➢	Ensure functional error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions, provide informative feedback, and avoid application crashes.
3. Architecture and Components
   -	Frontend: GUI Design
➢	Create wireframes and prototypes showcasing the application's layout and functionalities. Prioritize clarity in design elements for elderly users.
   -	Backend: Database and Logic
➢	Develop a schema for the database to store recipes, images, and ratings efficiently. Implement backend logic for data retrieval, updates, and search operations.
➢	Utilize thread pools to manage concurrent tasks and ensure smooth application performance.
➢	Apply synchronization techniques to avoid data corruption or inconsistencies during concurrent access.
4. Database Design
   -	Entities and Relationships:
➢	Define entities (Recipe, Image, Rating) and establish their relationships. For instance, a recipe can have an optional image/rating.
5. User Interface
   -	Functionality:
➢	Create a detailed protocol type for GUI layout, emphasizing readability and ease of navigation.
   -	Possible user interactions:
➢	Adding new recipes.
➢	Viewing details.
➢	Searching by name and rating.
